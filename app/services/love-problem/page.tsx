      'Unfavorable Venus or Mars, Mangal dosha, or Rahu-Ketu influence can cause love turbulence. Astrology suggests that planetary positions and aspects in one’s birth chart can reveal potential reasons for love and relationship problems. These can include issues like delayed marriage, relationship conflicts, or even attracting unhealthy relationships. Specific planetary placements, such as Saturn’s influence on the 5th or 7th house, Mars’s position in certain houses, or the influence of Rahu or Ketu, can indicate potential challenges.',
